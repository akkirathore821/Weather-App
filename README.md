# Weather Application using React.js

## Application Description
A Weather React App is a web application built using the React framework that leverages weather data from an external API to provide real-time weather information to users. The app fetches weather data through API requests, processes the received information, and dynamically displays it on the user interface.
## Key Features
* The app integrates with a weather API to fetch up-to-date weather information.
* The fetched weather data is dynamically displayed on the app's interface, allowing users to view current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant details.
* Users can manually input a city to provide location-based weather information.
* Users can search for weather information in different locations, enabling them to check the weather forecast for multiple places.
